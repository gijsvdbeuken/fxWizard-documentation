## Introduction <a name="heading-introduction"></a>

Within this document, you will find comprehensive documentation pertaining to all aspects of my application, whether it's documentation related to the script, front-end, back-end, or any other component. Everything you need can be located right here.

### With which fellow student would you like to (possibly) form a duo?

I choose to work independently on this project, mainly because the functional problem I want to solve is closely intertwined with my own interests and issues.

### What functional problem would you like to solve?

I frequently use Adobe After Effects, a software application used in video production. It often happens that repeated steps need to be taken in projects, which takes up significant extra time. Therefore, I plan to develop a plug-in that will significantly reduce these repetitive actions.

## General <a name="heading-general"></a>

Beneath, you'll find general documentation associated with this individual project.

## Research on ExtendScript <a name="research-on-extendscript"></a>

[Research on ExtendScript](https://github.com/gijsvdbeuken/IPS3-DB02-Thesis-individual)

## Research on protected routes <a name="research-on-protected-routes"></a>

## User Stories <a name="subheading-user-stories"></a>

As a motion designer, I want to enhance my efficiency in video production, So that I can focus more on creative aspects and less on repetitive tasks.

### Acceptance Criteria

- The plug-in should seamlessly integrate into the After Effects interface.
- The plug-in should have an intuitive and user-friendly interface.
- It should provide clear options for automating repetitive tasks commonly encountered in video production.
- The plug-in should allow customization to cater to different project requirements.
- The plug-in should significantly reduce the time needed for routine actions in After Effects.

### Sprint Log <a name="subheading-sprint-log"></a>

Within this section, I will provide an ongoing account of my progress throughout each sprint. For each sprint, I have established specific objectives, and I will assess my performance after each one to record the outcomes.

#### Sprint 1 <a name="subheading-sprint-1"></a>

##### Goals

- Think about what application I'm going to create
- Explore the requirements about this application
- Doing overall research about Extendscript

##### Evaluation

In summary, this sprint was quite successful, primarily focusing on orientation and exploration.

#### Sprint 2 <a name="subheading-sprint-2"></a>

##### Goals

- Learn about Extendscript
- Orient myself in Canvas
- Establish frameworks I want to use
- Build initial parts of the script

##### Evaluation

This sprint went smoothly and significantly contributed to my understanding of the project I'm going to develop. I've been able to refine my thoughts, which has enhanced my comprehension of the project's scope.

#### Sprint 3 <a name="subheading-sprint-3"></a>

##### Goals

- Setup web application
- Create login and create account page
- Connect database to application
- Create login UI on script

##### Evaluation

This sprint didn't meet my initial expectations for success. While I did successfully accomplish all the goals I had set for this sprint, I realized during the project delivery that there wasn't as much visible progress. Consequently, I'm setting higher expectations for the upcoming sprint to inject more momentum into this project.

#### Sprint 4 <a name="subheading-sprint-4"></a>

##### Goals

- Restructure application into different repositories
- Build user authentication on the login screen
- Create a context diagram
- Create the UI of the dashboardpage
- Explore about how I can incorporate CI/CD

##### Evaluation

Overall, this print went way better than the previous sprint. Everything I worked on worked as expected. In the next sprint, I will focus on the two learning outcomes I haven't set to "Beginning" yet. I will also think more about the security issues of my application.

#### Sprint 5 | 4 weeks<a name="subheading-sprint-5"></a>

##### Goals

- Solve problems when it comes to configuring unit-testing
- Get unit-testing up and running for front-end and API
- Implement unit-tests in CI/CD for both applicaitons
- Add secure routes on front-end application with user roles

##### Evaluation

This sprint went pretty well, and I managed to finish all goals I have set for it.

#### Sprint 6 <a name="subheading-sprint-6"></a>

##### Goals

- Create research document for protected routes
- Create research document for Adobe ExtendScript

##### Evaluation
